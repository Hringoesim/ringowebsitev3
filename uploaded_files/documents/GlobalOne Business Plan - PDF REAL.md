# GLOBALONE BUSINESS PLAN



# Voice-Native Travel eSIM with Number Portability



CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT Prepared: October 2025 Version: 2.0

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



# Business Overview



GlobalOne is a consumer-focused travel eSIM service providing permanent phone numbers with native voice calling across 180+ countries. Customers can port their existing mobile number from any carrier worldwide OR get a new EU number. We address a critical market gap: data-only eSIMs cannot receive banking SMS or make phone calls, and travelers lose their established phone number when switching carriers.

# The Opportunity



Market Size:

 €12B European travel connectivity market, growing 18% annually

Problem: Airalo (20M users, $1B valuation) offers data-only eSIMs; travelers still need voice/SMS for banking 2FA, emergency calls, and business communications. More critically, travelers must abandon their existing phone number or pay expensive roaming to keep it.

Solution: GlobalOne = Airalo + native calling + port your existing number OR get new EU number

# Competitive Advantages



1. Number portability IN: Port existing mobile number from any carrier worldwide - massive switching cost once customers migrate (28-month retention vs 18-month for new numbers)2. Only consumer-friendly, voice-native travel eSIM with built-in VoIP service 3. Dual numbering flexibility: Keep existing number OR get new EU number (or both)4. Validated technology: A&A's SIP2SIM operated 8+ years; dual-path technology strategy eliminates execution risk 5. Distribution moat: Partnerships with OTAs, fintechs, airlines

# TECHNOLOGY STACK



# Dual-Path Strategy



We've developed two parallel technology approaches to de-risk execution and ensure launch within 12 months regardless of partnership outcomes.

## Path A: A&A Partnership (Primary Strategy - 70% probability)



Status: Active discussions, targeting signed agreement within 60 days

# Benefits:



Proven technology: SIP2SIM/ONSIM infrastructure operational 8+ years Faster time-to-market: 3-4 month integration timeline Lower technical risk: VoLTE, SMS 2FA, native calling, number porting validated Reduced upfront capital: €50k licensing fee + €8-12/user wholesale pricing

# Our Role:



Consumer-facing mobile app (iOS/Android)Backend APIs and business logic UX/UI layer making technical solution accessible Customer support and marketing

# Partnership Terms (Proposed):



Exclusive EU consumer distribution rights€50k one-time licensing OR €5k/month + volume pricing

Technical integration support from A&A teamTechnical integration support from A&A team GlobalOne handles all consumer acquisition and support

# Timeline:



Month 1-2: Finalize partnership agreement Month 2-5: Technical integration and testing Month 6: Soft launch to first 100 users Month 7-12: Scale to 1,000+ users

Risk Mitigation: If A&A partnership fails or terms unfavorable by Month 2, immediately pivot to Path B.

## Path B: Custom Build (Backup Strategy - Ready to Execute)



Status: Architecture designed, vendor relationships established

# Components:



1. MVNE: Transatel (€80k deposit, 27 EU licenses)2. VoIP IMS: Telnyx (€50k setup, proven reliability)3. Number Porting: Transatel carrier interconnects 4. Fraud Prevention: TransNexus TruReach 5. Spam Protection: Hiya Protect

# Benefits:



Full technology stack ownership and control Better long-term unit economics (no licensing fees)Complete flexibility for feature development No dependency on external technology partner

# Challenges:



Higher upfront capital: €130k vs €50k Longer timeline: 6-9 months vs 3-4 months Greater technical complexity Requires stronger technical team from day one

# Timeline:



Month 1-3: MVNE onboarding, VoIP setup, team expansion Month 4-8: Core platform development and testingMonth 9: Soft launch to first 100 users Month 10-12: Scale to 1,000+ users

Risk Mitigation: Pre-vetted all vendors, received preliminary quotes, designed technical architecture. If Path A fails, we don't start from zero.

# Decision Framework



# We pursue Path A unless:



1. A&A declines or demands unfavorable terms (>€15/user wholesale)2. Technical due diligence reveals limitations (coverage gaps, reliability issues)3. Integration timeline exceeds 5 months 4. Partnership includes unfavorable exclusivity/control provisions

# We pivot to Path B by Month 2 if any above conditions are met.



# Funding Impact:



Path A total tech spend: €200k over 12 months Path B total tech spend: €310k over 12 months Our €500-600k raise covers either scenario with adequate runway

## Why We're Asking for €500-600k (Not €400k)



Original Plan Risk: €400k for 9 months left no buffer for:

Technology path pivoting (A&A to custom build = +€Partnership delays (common in enterprise sales)Higher-than-expected CAC during market validation Competitive response requiring faster scaling Number porting infrastructure costs

80k)

# Revised Plan Benefits:



12 months of true runway (vs 9 months with tight margins)Both technology paths fully funded (eliminates execution risk)Better pilot metrics (1,200 users vs 700-800)Series A-ready position (€1.2-1.5M ARR vs €175k)Reduced bridge financing need (€65-165k vs €265k)Number porting capability included (major competitive advantage)

Return on Investment: The additional €100-200k investment:

Increases user acquisition by 40-50%De-risks technology execution completely Adds number portability (55% higher LTV for ported customers)Positions for Series A raise 6 months earlier Improves Series A valuation by €5-10M (50-100x return on marginal capital)

# Pilot Success Metrics (Month 12)



### Minimum Success Criteria (Raises Series A at €25-30M valuation)



✓ 1,000+ paying users acquired✓ €1.2M ARR demonstrated✓ 50%+ gross margin validated✓ LTV:CAC >8:1 proven✓ 30%+ of Nomad/Business Pro users ported their numbers✓ 1+ partnership LOI signed (Tier 1 or 2)✓ Full EU regulatory compliance achieved✓ <35% annual churn rate

### Stretch Success Criteria (Raises Series A at €40-50M valuation)



✓ 1,500+ paying users✓ €1.8M ARR✓ 55%+ gross margin✓ LTV:CAC >10:1✓ 45%+ of premium users ported their numbers✓ 2+ partnership LOIs signed (at least 1 Tier 1)✓ Technology patent filed✓ <30% annual churn rate

# Future Funding Rounds

# EXIT STRATEGY & RETURNS



# Most Likely: Strategic Acquisition (70% probability, Year 5-6)



## Potential Acquirers



Telcos: Vodafone, Orange, Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica

Rationale: Modernize roaming offerings, capture digital nomad segment, number portability infrastructure

Fintechs: Revolut, Wise, N26

Rationale: Super-app strategy, cross-sell to 45M users, embedded finance + telecom

Travel Tech: Booking Holdings, Expedia, Airbnb

Rationale: Increase booking platform LTV, vertical integration, traveler lock-in

### Valuation Range: €100-200M



Revenue multiple: 2-5x ARR (€40M ARR = €80-200M)Per-user: €500-1,000 per user (fintech premium, high retention from porting)Comparable: Lebara acquired at €40/user; GlobalOne premium due to voice + porting moat

### Pre-Seed Investor Returns at €150M Exit (Midpoint)



€500k investment at €2.0M cap = 25% equity (diluted to ~15% post-Series A, ~12% post-Series B)Exit proceeds: €18M Return: 36x multiple, 105% IRR over 5-6 years

# Comparison if raised at original terms:



€400k at €2.5M cap = 16% equity →€16M exit proceeds (40x)

Key difference: €500k at €2M cap gives investors better downside protection and comparable upside

# Alternative: IPO (10% probability, Year 7-9)



Prerequisites: €100M+ ARR, 40%+ EBITDA margins Valuation: €500M-2.5B (5-12x revenue for high-growth SaaS)Pre-seed returns: 125-250x at IPO
